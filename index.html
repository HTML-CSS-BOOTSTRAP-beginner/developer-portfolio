          I'm an enthusiastic, responsible and hard working web developer. Being
          worked for different projects helped me to adopt to the changes
          quickly and made me a mature team worker. I am able to work well both
          in a team environment as well as using own initiative. I am able to
          work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
