          I'm an enthusiastic, responsible and hard working IT person. Being
          worked for different projects helped me to adopt to the changes
          quickly and made me a mature team worker. I am able to work well both
          in a team environment as well as using own initiative. I am able to
          work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.
